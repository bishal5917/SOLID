SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

The idea behind SRP is that every class,module or function in a program should have one responsibility
or purpose in a program.
As a common definition , every class should have a single responsibility to change.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module should have only one reason to 
change. It means that a class should have only one responsibility or purpose and should be focused on 
performing that specific task.

In Flutter, we can apply the Single Responsibility Principle by breaking down our code into smaller,
modular components, each responsible for a specific task.
