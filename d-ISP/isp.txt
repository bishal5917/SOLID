INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE

ISP states that no code should be forced to depend on method it doesnot use.
ISP splits interface that are very large into smaller and more specific ones 
so that clients will have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
Such shrunken interfaces are also called role interfaces.
ISP is intended to keep a system decoupled and thus easier to refactor,change & redeploy.
